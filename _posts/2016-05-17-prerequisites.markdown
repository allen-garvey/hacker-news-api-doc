This guide expects you to know a few things:

* basic JavaScript
* what JSON is (the data format the Hacker News API returns)
* basic jQuery (this guide uses the `jQuery.get()` function to simplify requests to the API)

If you're unclear on these topics, you can learn more at:

* [JavaScript Basics (Eloquent JavaScript)](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [JSON basics](http://www.elated.com/articles/json-basics/)
* [jQuery.get() Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/)

This guide also assumes that you know how to display data by inserting it into the DOM, so examples will only show how to actually retrieve data.
